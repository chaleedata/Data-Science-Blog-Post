# Project Motivation:
This project used [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=1406)I am interested in this dataset because it shows the result of life as a professional developer such as salary, work time, education.I analyzed this dataset to find interesting outcomes and find interesting results. I asked and answered for these:
- Which countries most survey result?
- Most countries think about Education is Important ?
- Python vs R language
- How many different average salary if you write r and python

# File Descriptions:
To complete this project, you will use Jupyter Notebooks through a workspace in the classroom. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to work with your code interactively while also being able to include descriptive and informative text to build a report.If you would like to learn more about  these tools, or you need some additional help to get started, you can check out  the course 
Introduction to Data Science in the [Become a Data Scientist](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) Core Concept of this course.
